    <p>The stream will begin with an introduction of the members, where they will greet the audience, give an overview of the topic, and explain the purpose of the session. This opening segment will take around five minutes and will be shown through video with live audio. A short warm-up discussion will follow to engage the audience and prepare them for the main conversation. Afterward, the hosts will dive into the main discussion, spending about twenty minutes unpacking the key points of the topic. The session will then move into an interactive segment, allowing viewers to ask questions, seek clarifications, and share concerns in real time. Next, a brief reflection activity will be conducted to encourage viewers to appreciate and accept themselves. Finally, the stream will close with a five-minute segment thanking the audience for their participation and support.

PROMOTIONAL PLAN

The promotional plan centers on using a playful, TikTok-inspired strategy where the group pretends to be well-known celebrities who have had a major influence on beauty standards. By adopting the personas of these iconic figures, the group creates a humorous yet eye-catching approach that immediately grabs attention on social media platforms. In each promotional clip, the “celebrities” greet viewers as if they’re recording a casual message for their fans. They introduce themselves using celebrity names and then proceed to invite the audience to join Group 1’s live stream. The message emphasizes that the stream will discuss beauty standards and their impact, particularly on women. This witty, character-based method not only aligns with current TikTok parody and impersonation trends but also helps deliver the invitation in a fun, relatable way that encourages female viewers to attend. By blending humor, celebrity culture, and relevant social issues, the promo plan becomes both entertaining and effective in attracting the target audience.</p>
